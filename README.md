# Horroscope_Project
Hey! This is my first python terminal game:
it consists of two inputs.
The first input is your name just for a sweet little hello!
The second is for your zodiac sign.
When you enter your zodiac sign the function Horoscope is called which goes through conditionals that see if your zodiac is equal to one of the 12 zodiac signs.
If so, it will print your horoscope!!
